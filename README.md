## Eval-AI : The smart AI paper evaluator

This was a project which started off as a university credits requirement, and now I'm on my way to make this better and better! 

*School and University teachers spend about **30- 40% of their time** on evaluation of homeworks, assignments and exam papers.*

This is where Eval-AI comes in. Automating paper evaluation, with just the answer key provided by the teacher and the student's answer copy! The project aims to not only evaluate MCQ type questions, but also subjective! 

* Trying.ipynb - for subjective answer evaluation
* Teacher_copy - for MCQs - teacher's copy
* Answer_copy - for MCQs - student's copy
