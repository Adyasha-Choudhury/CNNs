As of now, this repo contains the code for an emotion recognition system I made. It can recognise - *Happy, Sad, Fear, Angry, Surprise, Neutral*

I used a dataset from kaggle which was well arranged in folders for training and testing, and further each folder in it was labelled as per the emotion. All of them contained black and white pictures.
